The Galactic Radio Telescope is an new low-cost radio telescope designed to be
an all-sky monitor for bright radio bursts. Building on the success of STARE2,
we will search for fast radio bursts (FRBs) emitted from Galactic magnetars as
well as bursts from nearby galaxies. GReX will search down to ten microseconds
time resolution, allowing us to find new super giant radio pulses from Milky
Way pulsars and study their broadband emission. The proposed instrument will
employ ultra-wide band (0.7-2 GHz) feeds coupled to a high performance
(receiver temperature 10 K) low noise amplifier (LNA) originally developed for
the DSA-110 and DSA-2000 projects. In GReX Phase I (GReX-I), unit systems will
be deployed at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) and Big Smoky Valley,
Nevada. Phase II will expand the array, placing feeds in India, Australia, and
elsewhere in order to build up to continuous coverage of nearly 4Ï€ steradians
and to increase our exposure to the Galactic plane. We model the local magnetar
population to forecast for GReX, finding the improved sensitivity and increased
exposure to the Galactic plane could lead to dozens of FRB-like bursts per year.
