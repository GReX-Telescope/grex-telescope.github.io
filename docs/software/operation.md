# Operation Details

We'll flesh out all the details on operation soon, but in the meantime here are the critical details.

## Turning on the SNAP

To turn on the SNAP, SSH into the Pi (password is the same as the host machine) via

```sh
ssh pi@192.168.0.2
```

Then on the pi, run the following bash command

```sh
python3 pwup_snap.py
```
